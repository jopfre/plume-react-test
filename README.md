## Features

✅ Create a UI that will fetch and display Formula 1 seasons and their standings using this API. https://api-sports.io/documentation/formula-1/v1#section/Introduction
✅ You can use this wireframe which you should follow closely. https://www.figma.com/file/mp8jn2RafFut3hu5ETibS6/Developer-Test-Task?type=design&node-id=204-336&mode=design
✅ The app should fetch the list of available seasons and display them as a set of buttons aligned horizontally.
✅ When a user clicks on one of the seasons, fetch the standings of the season rankings and display them as a table.
✅ In Formula 1 there are 2 championships per season; one for drivers and one for teams. Display a switch in the UI that will switch between driver and team championships by fetching data from the appropriate endpoint. The driver's championship should be the default.
✅ For teams, table data should be sorted by position and should have columns for the position, team name, logo and points.
✅ For drivers, the table data should also be sorted by position and should have columns for the position, driver name, image, number and points.
✅ Feel free to use any UI library of your choice.
